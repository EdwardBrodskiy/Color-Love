# Color Love

Color Love is a project designed to help you discover colors that truly resonate with you. While there's no shortage of websites offering color palettes for developers, they often miss that personal touch that can truly define our projects.

Here's where Color Love steps in. This tool channels your color preferences through a chess ranking algorithm, helping you unearth the colors that speak to your style and taste. Engage with Color Affinity and embark on a journey to find the colors you truly love!
